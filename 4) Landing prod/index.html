        <h2 id="wholottie">Who is Lottie Butterbloom?</h2>
        <figure><img src="img/Lottie.jpg" id="lottie"></figure>
        <p>Lottie Butterbloom is no ordinary halfling. Born and raised in a small village on the edge of a vast forest,
            she grew up with a passion for both the culinary arts and the natural world around her. Her childhood was
            spent exploring the wilderness, learning to hunt, forage, and harvest the freshest ingredients nature could
            offer. But what truly set her apart was her unique ability to turn these humble ingredients into
            extraordinary dishes that captivated the taste buds of everyone who had the pleasure of trying her
            creations.

            From a young age, Lottie was mentored by her father, a renowned cook in the village. Under his careful
            guidance, she honed her skills, mastering the art of cooking over an open fire and experimenting with local
            herbs and spices. But her culinary journey didn't stop there. When a terrible famine hit her village, caused
            by dark cultists who worshipped the god of rot, Moander, Lottie's talents were tested in ways she had never
            imagined. Her cooking became a source of hope and nourishment for those around her, and her skills as a
            hunter and forager helped keep her community fed during those dark times.

            However, Lottie's life took a dramatic turn when a group of adventurers passed through her village, intent
            on defeating the cultists. Despite their initial refusal to bring her along, Lottie followed them in secret,
            convinced they couldn't survive without a proper meal. Eventually, the group welcomed her into their fold,
            and it was during this adventure that Lottie discovered her calling as both a ranger and a chef. She learned
            the ways of the wilderness from the ranger of the group, Rowan Oakenshield, for whom she secretly harbored
            feelings, and used her culinary skills to keep the group well-fed and battle-ready.

            After helping to defeat the cultists and restore balance to the land, Lottie's reputation as a master cook
            grew. She joined the Guild of Cooks, where she refined her craft further and became known for her bold,
            inventive recipes. Her dishes combine the wild flavors of the forest with sophisticated culinary techniques,
            and her insistence on using only the finest ingredients has made her a culinary legend.

            Now, Lottie Butterbloom shares her culinary wisdom through her exclusive recipe book, spice blends, and
            personal cooking journal, offering a taste of the wilderness and a glimpse into her remarkable journey.
            Whether you're a novice cook or a seasoned chef, Lottie's creations are sure to inspire you to elevate your
            cooking and embrace the flavors of the natural world.</p>
